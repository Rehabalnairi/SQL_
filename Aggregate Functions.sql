--Aggregate Functions
--1. Count the Total Number of Employees
select * from Employee
select COUNT(*) as TotalEmployees from Employee;

--2. Calculate the Total Salary (ignoring NULL values)
select Sum (salary) as TotalSalary from Employee;

--3. Find the Average Salary
select AVG (salary) from Employee;
--4. Find the Highest and Lowest Salary
select MAX (salary) as MAxSalary from Employee;
select MIN (salary) as MinSalary from Employee;

------GROUP BY-----
--Example 1: Group By Single Column (Employee name with total salary)
Select  count(salary) from  Employee GROUP BY name;

--Example 2: Group By Multiple Columns (Student subject and year) 
Select subject, year, COUNT(*) as student_count from Student
GROUP BY subject, year;

-------HAVING--
--Example 1: Departments with total salary ≥ 100,000
select department, SUM(salary)  as  totalSalary  from Employee
GROUP BY department 
HAVING SUM(salary) >= 100000;

--Example 2: Subjects with more than 1 student in any year
select subject, year, count (*) as StudentCount From Student
GROUP BY subject, year
HAVING count (*) > 1;
